# Python for the DataJam

Python for the DataJam is a resource that will teach you the basics of Github collaboration and Python for data analysis. To write our code we will be using the IDE(Integrated Development Environment) Jupytr notebooks in combination with the Python libraries Pandas, MatplotLib, and Seaborne. You will learn how to use these tools by walking through a mock data-jam project. This project will analyze the effect of a pandenmic on different mental health factors. The reasearch questions that we will adress in the project are: 
* What factors are correlated most with mental health decline during a pandemic?
* Do pandemics have a negative effect on mental health?
* When compared to COVID, can H1N1 be considered a true pandemic?

# Directions

To use these resources, first click on the above link. This will take you to the main page of the repository, where there are a few files.  Start with the GitHub_Introduction read the introduction then complete the First_Steps guide. After completing the above steps you should have a working knowledge of GitHub, a new account, and the GitHub Desktop application. Next, navigagte to the python_tutorial and work your way through the tutorial (Data_Cleaning.ipynb, Statistical_Analaysis.ipynb, Visualizations.ipynb). All the datasets you will need to work your way through the tutorial are available in the datasets folder. Once you have learned to use GitHub and Python we hope these will be valuable tools for you to collaborate with your team as you take on a research question of your own!

# Python for the DataJam

Python for the DataJam is a resource that will teach you the basics of Github collaboration and Python for data analysis. To write our code we will be using the IDE(Integrated Development Environment) JupytrLab run through Anaconda-Navigator. We will also use the Python libraries Pandas, MatplotLib, and Seaborne. You will learn how to use these tools by walking through a mock data-jam project. This project will analyze the effect of a pandenmic on different mental health factors. The reasearch questions that we will adress in the project are: 
* What factors are correlated most with mental health decline during a pandemic?
* Do pandemics have a negative effect on mental health?
* When compared to COVID, can H1N1 be considered a true pandemic?

## Github
### What is GitHub
In essence, GitHub is a website that allows coders to collaborate, save their code, and track changes made to it. GitHub is especially helful when working on a coding project with multiple contributors as every persons changes can be viewed individually. The ability to clone repositories to work on the project independently prevent errors from occuring in the master files. 
### Where should I start? 
Before you do anything else, you should create a GitHub account. To do this: 
* Navigate to the [GitHub home page](https://github.com/)
* Click the *Sign Up* button in the top right corner of the page. 
* Go through the sign-up process. Just click through these menus and sign up for the **free** version of GitHub. 
* To learn the basics of GitHub head to this [link](https://github.com/nmcdowell00/python_for_the_datajam/blob/main/GitHub_Introduction/First_Steps.md)

GitHub can be used through different methods but in this tutorial we will focus on interacting with GitHub Desktop. GitHub Desktop is a free service made by GitHub that allows users to interact with their repositories efficiently. To download this program for Mac or Windows, navigate to this [link](https://desktop.github.com/). Click the large download button for Mac or the smaller link in the bottom right for windows.

## JupytrLab and Andaconda
### What is Anaconda? 
Anaconda-Navigator is a package manager while JupytrLab is a program for writing Python. What a package manager does is keep everything behind the scenes organized, the updates, the files, etc. Anaconda-Navigator provides the strucutre that allows Jupytr Notebooks to run. 
### What is Jupytr
JupytrLab is a software application that is used for writing and executing Python scripts. JupytrLab is a revised version of Jupytr notebooks, the two names are referencing the same interface. What makes JupytrLab special is its ability create notebooks that can contain both code and text markup. Jupytr is also organized into cells, allowing you to can execute 1 line of code at a time. This method creates highly readable code. 
### Downloading Anaconda Navigator
To download Anaconda navigate to this [link](https://www.anaconda.com/). There should be download buttons for all relevant operating systems. After downloading Anaconda, launch the program. In the window you are presented with you can lauch JupytrLab by clicking on the icon for JupytrLab. To learn a bit of the Jupytr basics you can check out this [tutorial](https://github.com/pitt-sci-cmpinf0010/Intro-to-Jupyter/blob/master/Lab-Lesson.ipynb).

## Python
We will be using Python to perform our data analysis. Over the past decade Python has become one of the most used coding languages in the world. This is because Python is highly legible and capable of performing powerful functions and analysis. Python also has 100's of additioanal libraries that we can implement. These libraries have prebuilt functions that act as shortcuts for performing certain tasks. The libraries we will be using are: 
* **PANDAS:** a library designed for data analysis through its integration of dataframes
* **MatPlotLib:** built to improve the plotting power of Python
* **SeaBorn:** Used to enhance the visual elements of plots.

## Notes: 
This project was completed with funding from Pitt Honors Communitty Research Fellowship and guidancnce from Pittsburgh DataWorks. I would like to thank Judy Cameron, Brian MacDonald, and Herman Everett for their mentorship.

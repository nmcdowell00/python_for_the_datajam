# Python for the DataJam

In this repository you will find thorough explantions of how to use Python and GitHub to improve your DataJam projects. The GitHub tutorial walks you through creating your first repository(like this one) as well as executing basic commands needed to navigate the platfrom efficiently. The Python tuturial will use an example based approach. to demonstrate how effective Python is for a DataJam project. 

# Research Project

This project will analyze the effect of a pandenmic on different mental health factors. The will be invesigating the relationship between these factors and the H1N1 and COVID 19 pandemic. My reasearch questions are: 
* What factors are correlated most with mental health decline during a pandemic?

* When compared to COVID, can H1N1 be considered a true pandemic?

After completing the above steps you should have a working knowledge of GitHub, a new account, and the GitHub Desktop application. Next, navigagte to the python_tutorial and work your way through the tutorial (Data_Cleaning.ipynb, Statistical_Analaysis.ipynb, Visualizations.ipynb). All the datasets you will need to work your way through the tutorial are available in the datasets folder. Once you have learned to use GitHub and Python we hope these will be valuable tools for you to collaborate with your team as you take on a research question of your own!

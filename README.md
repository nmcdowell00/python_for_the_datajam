# Python for the DataJam

In this repository you will find thorough explantions of how to use Python and GitHub to improve your DataJam projects. The GitHub tutorila walks you through creating your first repository(like this one) as well as executing basic commands needed to navigate the platfrom efficiently. The Python tuturial will use an example based approach. to demonstrate how effective Python is for a DataJam project. 

# Why should we use GitHub for our DataJam projects?
For one, GitHub will allow your team to work more efficiently on your projects. Every team member will have access to the files and the ability to work on them independently. Also, it will allow mentors to offer better assistance in solving coding problems. If the code that is giving you trouble is stored on Github, a mentor download the code to their local machine and work with it. This will help mentors give the best possible answer to a problem you might have. 
In addition to helping with your datajam projects, using GitHub will help you build valuable skilsl.  GitHub is estimated to be used by 87% of developers. GitHub has grown so popular that it is used in fields outside of computing; authors use GitHub while writing books to more efficiently document their process. Learnign to intereact with GitHub is a skill that you can use to help build your resume. 

I hope you find this guide entertaining!(and useful)

# Notes:
- add a page explaining data types(ex. catergorical)

# Meeting Notes 
- According to Dr. Cameron, there is a team working on their datajam project over the summer. These are most likely going to be the most dedicated students so it interviewing them about their experience with the repository might not be effective. I think that askign these students a series of questions that judged their experience of Python might be a better use of time. From this, I could learn what even the more advanced students might want more information on. This would help me build a more expansive and helpful tool for the DataJam.

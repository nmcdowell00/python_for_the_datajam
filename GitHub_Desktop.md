# Downloading GitHub Desktop 
GitHub Desktop is the tool that we will be using connect our local machine to GitHub. Navigate to this [link](https://desktop.github.com/) to get started with your download.
# Cloning your Repository
If you completed the guide that was linken in the *What is Github* file you should have created a repository with one file in this. We will now go through the process of creating a copy of this repository on your local machine. Start by clicking the icon in the top right corner of this page <img src = "/images/icon.png" height = "20"> and select the option that says *Your Repositories*. From here, select the *hello-world* repository. You will now want to click the green *Code* button on the upper right hand side of the repository. This will bring up a menu, from which you will select *Open with Github Desktop*. A pop up menu should appear the prompts you asks for permission to open the file in Github Desktop, click *Allow*. You should now be presented with this menu.<hr><p align = "center"> <img src = "/images/local_path.png" height = 250 align = "center"></p> <hr>
In this menu you will want to specify the location wehre your cloned repository will be stored. To do this you can change the path in the *Local Path* section. Personally, I want my clone to be stored on my desktop. Maybe you have a different preference? If you have any desire to change it just added the additional steps in the path, followed by the repository name. Once you have the desired path, click *Clone*. 
# Editing the Local Repository 
Now that you have the repository cloned to your local machine you can start interacting with it. This means that you can change the files as much as you want without affecting anyhing on the central repository. Before you do anyhting you will want to start a new branch. On the toolbar of GitHub Desktop you should see a square that says *Current Branch*. <img src = "/images/current_branch.png" width = 100>. When you click this icon it should bring up a menu that looks like this <img src  = "/images/branch_menu.png">. In ths menu, select *new branch* and name it something like *yourname_edits*(in my case it would be *nate_edits*. This way you won't get confused when you are merging the branch.

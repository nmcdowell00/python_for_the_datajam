    "- **R-squared**: the r2(2=squared) value represents how much of the variance in the data can be explained by the model. The higher the value, the better the model fits. \n",
    "- **Adjusted R-squared**: The adjusted r2 value is used to correct some of the problems with raw r2 score. Adjusted r2 accounts for the number of variables with a dataset, only increasing the r2 score if the variable aids in prediction to a degree greater than what would occur simply by chance. The adjusted r2 value can be used as a more accurate way to determine the fit of a model. \n",

In statistical terms, RMSE is the standard deviation of the residuals, residuals meausring the distance between data points and teh regression line. RMSE tells you how spread the data points are around the regression line; how well the data fits to the model. Lower values for RMSE mean a better fit because ethe data is *less* far from the model.\n",

    "After our analysis, which includes the visualitions as well as the linear models above, we have created a story that shows the how each factor contributes to the mental health patterns in the US. In our scaled visualizations we saw the differences between many factors, the highlight being the vast diffference between the number of h1n1 and COVID deaths. \n",

    "We investigated the differnces further by conduction a linear regression that we built to predict the occurence of deaths due to each virus based on the a group of independent  variables: alcohol_deaths, alcohol sales, drug_deaths, homicides, suicide_deaths, percent unemployed. The adjusted r score of our COVID model was 0.565, 3 times higher than the R score for the H1N1 model. This indicates that the COVID model was a much better fit for the data; the changes in the data could be explained 3 times better with the COVID model than the h1n1 model. Our RMSE scores for both models were slightly more similiar. COVID scored 0.18 and H1N1 scored 0.21. This score also supports that the covid model was more prescise as the average varaince of the model from the data was lower. I ran a third model that group the dummy variables from bith H1N1 and COVID. The R score was right in the middle of the other two but the RMSE was the highest out of all three. I believe that this is because the model was being built to predict at two different points, making the likelihood for error higher."

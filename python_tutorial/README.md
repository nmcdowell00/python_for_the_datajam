# Welcome to the Python Tutorial !!


## Project Introduction

The *Python for the DataJam* python tutorial was built to mirror the project completed in the [DataJam Handbook](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/513777bbe4b0aafa8d406eb4/t/6186cb633ae329480fd7dc40/1636223853714/Data+Jam+Manual.pdf), written by Tony Robol. I completed my project using Python because it is a coding language well suited to take on DataJam projects. This project is meant to resemble Tony's project ; however, there were some changes I had to make to my approach that I will go over 

## How to Use the Tutorial. 

The Python tutorial is separated into 3 sections. 

#### Data Cleaning 
This first notebook shows you how to take data files from your desktop and upload them into Jupytr Notebooks. You will then be shown how to *clean* the data: take our certain rows, delete or rename columns, edit data types, etc. Hopefully, this notebook will give you a good idea on how to begin your data jam project in Python. 

#### Visualizations
This notebook will show you how create visualizations to help illustrate a pattern or story in your data. This notebook will introduce you to Seaborn and MatPlotLib, two very powerful Python Libraries. 

#### Linear Regression
Here we see how to use a regression to help answer our research questions. In this notebook you will be shown how to produce and interpret certain statistical measures that will help support or reject your hypothesis. 

## Source Overview

I chose to analyze the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the H1N1 pandemic. Since COVID-19 is a recent(even current) pandemic, I had some issues with finding complete datasets. As mentioned earlier, I wanted this notebook to resemble Tony Robol's DataJam Handbook; however, many of his sources did not include data from the timefram of the COVID pandemic. This took some problem solving but I was able to find data suitable for conducting this research project, all of which are listed below. 

#### US population

    - Data collected from the US census bureau 
    
#### H1N1 Data(2009)

#### COVID Data

#### Unemployment Rate

    - Copy and paste into excel file. Will then convert to pdf
    
#### Drug Deaths, Alcohol Deaths, Suicide, Homicide

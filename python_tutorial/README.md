# Project Introduction

The *Python for the DataJam* python tutorial was built to mirror the project completed in the DataJam Handbook, written by Tony Robol. I completed my project using Python as I feel that is a coding language well suited to take on DataJam projects. I built my project as close to Tony's project as possible; however, I had to vary my approach. I chose to analyze the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the H1N1 pandemic. Since COVID-19 is a recent(even current) pandemic my process for data collection was differnt from his. Many of the sources that Tony used did not record data during COVID. I spent time working through many different sources; in the end, I found CDC's WonderAPI to be the most consisent and up-to-date source. 

### Source Overview

The data for this project is cited in the links below: 
#### US population
* Source: [here](https://www.multpl.com/united-states-population/table/by-month)
Data collected from the US census bureau 
#### H1N1 Data(2009)
    - Source: https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/estimates_2009_h1n1.htm
    -  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/flu-data
    - From April 12, 2009 to April 10, 2010, CDC estimated there were 60.8 million cases (range: 43.3-89.3 million), 274,304 hospitalizations (range: 195,086-402,719), and 12,469 deaths (range: 8868-18,306) in the United States due to the (H1N1)pdm0 virus.

#### COVID Data

# How to Use the Tutorial. 

The Python tutorial is separated into 3 sections. The first section is "Data Cleaning". This notebook shows you how to take data files from your desktop and read them into Jupytr Notebooks. You will then be shown how to *clean* the data: take our certain rows, delete or rename columns, edit data types, etc. Hopefully, this notebook will give you a good idea on how to begin your data jam project in Python. 
  
After reading the "Data Cleaning" notebook, you should work through the "Visualizations" notebook. Here you will see how create visualizations to help illustrate a pattern or story in your data. This notebook will introduce you to Seaborn and MatPlotLib, two very powerful Python Libraries. 
  
Finally, you will finish the tutorial by review the "Linear Regression" notebook. Here we see how to use a regression to help answer our research questions. In this notebook you will be shown how to determine and interpret certain statistical measures that will help support or reject your hypothesis.

# How to Use the Tutorial. 

The Python tutorial is serperated into 3 sections. The first section is "Data Cleaning". This notebook shows you how to take data files from you desktop and read them into Jupytr Notebooks. You will then be shown how to *clean* the data: take our certain rows, delete or rename columns, edit data types, etc. Hopefully, this notebook will give you a good idea on howto begin your data jam project in Python. 
  
After reading the "Data Cleaning" notebook, you should work through the "Visualizations" notebook. Here you will see how create visulations to help illustrate a pattern or story in your data. 
  
Finally, you will finish the tutorial by review the "Linear Regression" notebook. Here we see how to use a regression to help answer our reasearch questions.

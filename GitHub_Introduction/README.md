# What is GitHub?
In essence, GitHub is a website that allows coders to store their code as well as track changes made to it. GitHub is especially helful when working on a coding project with multiple contributors. The ability to clone repositories to work on the project independtly which helps prevent errors from occuring in the master files. When the code is working on users local machines they are able to push the code to the master repository, updatiing the files. The master repo keeps track of all changes
made to it meaning that any mistake can be reversed, making using GitHub very seucure.

# Why should we use GitHub for our DataJam projects?
For one, GitHub will allow your team to work more efficiently on your projects. Every team member will have access to the files and the ability to work on them independently. Also, it will allow mentors to offer better assistance in solving coding problems. If the code that is giving you trouble is stored on Github, a mentor download the code to their local machine and work with it. This will help mentors give the best possible answer to a problem you might have. 
In addition to helping with your datajam projects, using GitHub will help you build valuable skilsl.  GitHub is estimated to be used by 87% of developers. GitHub has grown so popular that it is used in fields outside of computing; authors use GitHub while writing books to more efficiently document their process. Learnign to intereact with GitHub is a skill that you can use to help build your resume.

# How does one use GitHub? 
GitHub can be used through different methods but in this tutorial we will focus on interacting with GitHub Desktop. GitHub Desktop is a free service made by GitHub that allows users to interact with their repositories efficiently. To download this program for Mac or Windows, navigate to this [link](https://desktop.github.com/). Click the large download button for Mac or the smaller link in the bottom right for windows. 

# How do I start to learn Github? 
Before you do anything else, you should create a GitHub account. To do this, clicking the *Sign Up* button in the top right corner of GitHub page. This should take you to a page that walks you through the sign-up process. During the sign up process it will ask you what types of tools you will need or who you are going to be collaborating with; the answers to these questions don't matter. Just click through these menus and sign up for the **free** version of GitHub. After signing up you should go over the [basics](https://github.com/nmcdowell00/python_for_the_datajam/blob/main/GitHub_Introduction/basics.md) in this repository which will help you through the some of the basic GitHub actions.

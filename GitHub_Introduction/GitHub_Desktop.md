# Cloning your Repository

Cloning your repository means creating a folder on your desktop that is linked to your repository. 
# Editing the Local Repository 
Now that you have the repository cloned to your local machine you can start interacting with it. This means that you can change the files as much as you want without affecting anyhing on the central repository. Before you do anyhting you will want to start a new branch. On the toolbar of GitHub Desktop you should see a square that says *Current Branch*. <hr><img src = "/images/current_branch.png" width = 1000>.<hr> When you click this icon it should bring up a menu that looks like this:<hr><p align = "center"><img src  = "/images/branch_menu.png" height = 250 align = "center"></p><hr>. In ths menu, select *new branch* and name it something like *yourname_edits*(in my case it would be *nate_edits* This way you won't get confused when you are merging the branch.

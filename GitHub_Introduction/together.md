to it. GitHub is especially helful when working on a coding project with multiple contributors. The
ability to clone repositories to work on the project independtly which helps prevent errors from occuring in the master files. When the code is working on users local machines they are able to push 
the code to the master repository, updatiing the files. The master repo keeps track of all changes
made to it meaning that any mistake can be reversed, making using GitHub very seucure.

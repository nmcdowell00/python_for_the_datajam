## How to Clone a File to your Desktop
Cloning is one of the first steps in using GitHub. Cloning a repository will allow you to intereact with the files within the safety of your local machine. 
In this example, we will be using my repository *clone_me* that you can find on my page, *nmcdowell00*. 
### First 
Navigate to the green *code* button in the top right of the repository home page
![](/images/green_code.png  | width = 50)
<img src = "/images/green_code.png" height="100">
When this button is clicked, you be presented with a menu that looks like this: 
![](/images/code_dropdown.png)
In this menu you will want to click *Open with GitHub Desktop*. A pop-up menu should appear ![](/images/open_with_GD.png) which will ask if you really want to open this file in the Desktop App. I personally find it easier to check the box stating *Always allow*. This just saves some hassle and clicks in the future.

## How to Clone a File to your Desktop
Cloning is one of the first steps in using GitHub. Cloning a repository will allow you to intereact with the files within the safety of your local machine. 
In this example, we will be using my repository *clone_me* that you can find on my page, *nmcdowell00*. 
## 1 
Navigate to the green *code* button in the top right of the repository home page <br>
<img src = "/images/green_code.png" height="100">
## 2
When this button is clicked, you be presented with a menu that looks like this: <br>
<img src = "/images/code_dropdown.png" height = "400" width = "400"> 
You should specify the place wehre you wnat to store the file in the box 
## 3
In this menu you will want to click *Open with GitHub Desktop*. A pop-up menu should appear <hr> <img src ="/images/open_with_GD.png" width = "400" height = "200"> <br> which will ask if you really want to open this file in the Desktop App. I personally find it easier to check the box stating *Always allow*. This just saves some hassle and clicks in the future.

The following steps should bring you to something that looks like this <img src = "/images/local_path.png"> In this menu you will want to specify the location you want this repository to be stored on your machine. By altereing the text in the *Local Path* box you can change where this repo will be stored. I want it to appear on my desktop so I will keep the path as */Users/natemcdowell/Desktop/clone_me(or the name of the repo you wan to clone)*
## 5 
The final thing you will want to do is fetch the origin. To do this click the *Fetch Origin* button in the menu bar <img scr = "/images/fetch_origin.png">
This will pull all the files from the master to the copy on your local machine. You should always pull the origin before working on the repository to make sure you have the most up to date files.

# Introduction

In this guide you will learn how to: 
 - create and manipulate a repository
 - make and use a new branch 
 - alter files and commit them to GitHub
 - open and complete a pull request 

# Creating a repository
To create a respository all you have to do is  follow these steps. 

1. Navigate to the plus sign in the top right corner of you window <img src = "/images/plus_sign.png" height = 40>  In the menu that opens upon clicking, select **New Repository**. Now you will be shown a page that allows you to name the repository, adjust its privacy, as well add a README file. 


2. Now name your repository something that communicates its purpose! In your case you can name it *first*. If you would like, add a short descriptipn of what is contained within the repository in the description field. 

3. Next, set your repository to public or private. 

4. The last thing that you should have to do is select the box that says *Add a README file*. This will simply add an empty markdown file to your repository. Make sure to always add a README file. Now click "Create Repository". 

# Branching

Branching is a very powerful tool in GitHub as it allows you to keep different versions of a repository simultaneously. After creating a repositoty you will  have one branch called **main**. The main branch is thoguht of as the final or master version of the repository.  When you want to make changes to the repository you can create an alternate branch.  In the alternate branch, all new edits or material will remain independent from the main branch. Branching will be especially helpful when multiple might be working in the repository. If changes are made to main branch when you are working on a different one, you can simply submit a pull requeest to update your branch to the changes. Here 

To create a branch you want to be in the "Code" tab of your repository. On this page you will see an icon named "main" <img src = "/images/main.png" height = 40>  . To create a new branch, click on this icon and type a name into the text box, something like "edits". Then click the banner that says "**Create branch: edits from main**.

After you click, the window should relocate you to your new branch. This branch should look exactly the same as the main branch. Now, lets make some edits! 

## Making changes 


Lets make the first edit in your new branch. 

1. Click on the README fild and spice it up a bit. After clicking on the file you should see a pencil icon on the right side of your page. Select this to begin working on the file. 

2. Type a few lines into the editor then navigate down to the window at the bottom of the page titled "Commit Changes". All of the edits that you save on this branch will be stroed as commits. 

3. In the box at the bottom you can add a short note about what is being saved in the commit. These notes will become more helpful when you start working on larger files and make more complex edits. 

4. Lets finsh up and hit "Commit Changes". 

### Pull Request

Now that you have made your desired changes it is time to merge your branch to main. To do this you will need to open a pull request. A pull request is a will allow other users on the repository to review the changes you have made to the files. Each pull request will illustrate the exact edits you made to the files. Changes, additions, and deletions will each be highlighted in a different color. Since there should be only one person in this repository, you can review and merge the pull request your self. 

Lets start the pull request. First, navigate to the Pull requests tab in your repository then select the blue icon on the right that says "New Pull Request". In the Example Comparisons box you can select the branch that you want to commit. You should now see a box that has some highlighted text depending on what you changed. If these changes look good you can select the "Create Pull Reqeust" button. Leave a quick comment on what your pull request contains before hitting "Create pull request" once again. 
 
### Merging
Now that we have created the pull request, we can review it and merge it to main. After you created the request you should have been brought to the conversation page. A bubble highlighted in blue should contain information about your edits as well as a "merge pull request" button. Before clicking "merge pull request" you should check if there are any conflicts in the branch. Hopefullly in your case there should be a blue check mark that says there are no conflicts; however, if there are you can reply to the pull request with suggestions to resolve the conflict. Since we have no conflicts, lets merge the branch by clicking "Merge pull request" then, "Confirm merge". 

After a succesful merge you should see the option to delete the branch. To keep your repository clean you should the delte the branch. If you want to continue to make new edits, simply open a new branch and repeat the proccess you just learned!
